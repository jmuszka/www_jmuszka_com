In each of my courses, I aim to achieve as high of a GPA as possible and seek to squeeze as much as possible out of my courses. My favourite courses so far have been Computer Architecture, Theory of Computation, and Machine Learning.",

        "paragraph2" : "In the field of computer science, I am captivated by a wide variety of topics. Since my first year, I have been working remotely as a web developer, where I have built and deployed a handful of websites and full-stack applications. This job has exposed me to many different front-end and back-end frameworks, and has taught me good development practices, collaboration, and IT skills. I am currently working with the 3DWestern team to develop a full-stack app to process 3D-printing orders. Aside from web development, I am becoming increasingly interested in cryptography. I have begun self-studying various fundamentals of cryptography, and am considering pursuing a Masters degree related to quantum cryptography.",

I run Arch Linux on my computer, GrapheneOS on my Pixel phone, and have my own physical Debian Linux server which I host this website on, along with various projects. In my free time I enjoy reading books and playing video games. My favourite genre of books to read are historical-biographical books; I am currently reading American Sphinx: The Character of Thomas Jefferson by Joseph Ellis. When I am stressed, I partake in hiking, archery, and going to the gym in order to decompress",
